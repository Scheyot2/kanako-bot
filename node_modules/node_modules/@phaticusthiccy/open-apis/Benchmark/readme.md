    description: 'The GeForce GTX TITAN was an enthusiast-class graphics card by NVIDIA, launched on February 19th, 2013. Built on the 28 nm process, and based on the GK110 graphics processor, in its GK110-400-A1 variant, the card supports DirectX 12. Even though it supports DirectX 12, the feature level is only 11_0, which can be problematic with newer DirectX 12 titles. The GK110 graphics processor is a large chip with a die area of 561 mmÂ² and 7,080 million transistors. It features 2688 shading units, 224 texture mapping units,  and 48 ROPs. NVIDIA has paired 6 GB GDDR5 memory with the GeForce GTX TITAN, which are connected using a 384-bit memory interface. The GPU is operating at a frequency of 836 MHz, which can be boosted up to 876 MHz, memory is running at 1502 MHz (6 Gbps effective). \n' +
      " Being a dual-slot card, the NVIDIA GeForce GTX TITAN draws power from 1x 6-pin + 1x 8-pin power connector, with power draw rated at 250 W maximum. Display outputs include: 2x DVI, 1x HDMI, 1x DisplayPort. GeForce GTX TITAN is connected to the rest of the system using a PCI-Express 3.0 x16 interface. The card's dimensions are 267 mm x 111 mm x 38 mm, and it features a dual-slot cooling solution.  Its price at launch was 999 US Dollars.",

## IMPORTANT NOTES

Some keys may retrun as `undefined`. That's means, there is no result for that.

Also some keys are defined as a function. You can fetch these using `response.this()`
